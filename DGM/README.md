# AIM II - Practical Deep Generative Models

This repository contains the practical for generative models. It is based on PyTorch and will mostly be focused on applying AEs and diffusion models to the task of unsupervised anomaly segmentation. 
We provide healthy and anomalous data, a data-loader, a AE model, training routines, evaluaton scripts, and others as a starting point.
